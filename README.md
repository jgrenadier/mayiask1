mayiask is a simple flask application written in python.
It is based mostly on my review of examples found in
https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook .
I started with Python code found in example notebooks 
to build this standalone flask web application.

The purpose of this app is to explore if google's generative AI
could be useful as a learning tool for how to ask better
questions.  The purpose is not to do the work of a journalist
but rather to help refine questions that the user might 
ask a public figure.  Perhaps the questioner might be a layman
participating in a AMA (Ask Me Anything online event) or a
citizen attending a political town hall or a journalism student.

I felt it worked very well but I am just a software engineer.
I welcome feedback and would like to work on the more interesting
questions of how to improve questions with domain specific data
rather than just the "prompt engineering" that this app uses today.
